### <u>Background</u>

Employees quit for a variety of reasons. One of the main reasons is an unsafe work environment. In addition to compensating employees fairly, and treating them with a sense of dignity and equality, employers are obligated to maintain a safe workplace for their employees, so that they can focus on their job responsibilities rather than worrying about the work environment. However, many employers fail to do so, and employees are injured every year as a result. According to the International Labour Organisation, a worker dies every 15 seconds from a work-related accident or disease around the world. A work environment that is unsafe not only can cause significant disruption and cost to both employer and employee, but also put employer at risk of workplace morale, productivity, turnover, and reputation.
