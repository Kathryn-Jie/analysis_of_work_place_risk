Occupational Health and Safety

### Introduction
People often enter their industries based on career prospects, monetary and educational factors. Very seldom have people considered the safety profile of the industries that they will be involved in. However, the main reason employees quit is an unsafe work environment. According to the International Labour Organisation, a worker dies every 15 seconds from a work-related accident or disease around the world. An unsafe work environment not only can cause significant disruption and cost to both employer and employee but also put an employer at risk of workplace morale, productivity, turnover and reputation. Hence, our app is built with the main aim to identify workplace risk of injuries and determine whether an employee may be at risk.
