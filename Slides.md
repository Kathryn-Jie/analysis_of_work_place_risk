**Problem Statement :**

Employees quit for a variety of reasons. One of the main reasons is an unsafe work environment. In addition to compensating employees fairly, and treating them with a sense of dignity and equality, employers are obligated to maintain a safe workplace for their employees, so that they can focus on their job responsibilities rather than worrying about the work environment. However, many employers fail to do so, and employees are injured every year as a result. According to the International Labour Organisation, a worker dies every 15 seconds from a work-related accident or disease around the world. A work environment that is unsafe not only can cause significant disruption and cost to both employer and employee, but also put employer at risk of workplace morale, productivity, turnover, and reputation.

type:prompt

**How it works :**

It has the following features<br>
1. Dashboard<br>
<small>This tab sets out the basic info of the app, which are title, domain, data source, data info, objectives and problem statement.</small><br><br>
2. Risk Insight<br>
<small>This tab shows the basic info of the data, such as number of observation, total injuries cases, dataset time period and attributes. It also consists of 4 tabsets which showing the graph for exploratory data analysis </small><br><br>
3. Explore Risk<br>
<small>This tab allows users to select industry, work activity and work tool to explore risk by year, injury level, and past incident. It also allow the user to download the dataset in several formats, such as csv, xlsx and pdf.</small><br><br>
